# Network Diagnostic Script

A simple **network diagnostic tool** to check host connectivity, HTTP/HTTPS responses, open ports, and traceroute paths. Ideal for quick network troubleshooting or monitoring multiple servers.

## Features

- **Ping**: Test basic network connectivity.
- **HTTP/HTTPS Check**: Inspect server response using `curl`.
- **Port Check**: Verify if TCP ports (e.g., 22, 80, 443) are open.
- **Traceroute**: Show the route packets take to reach the host.

Works on both **Linux/Ubuntu** and **Windows Git Bash** (with PowerShell for port checks).


## Prerequisites

**Linux / Ubuntu:**

- `curl`
- `nc` (netcat)
- `traceroute`  

**Windows (Git Bash):**

- `curl`
- `PowerShell` (for port checks)
- `tracert` instead of `traceroute`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/network-diagnostic-script.git
cd network-diagnostic-script

2. Make the script executable (Linux/Ubuntu):

chmod +x network_check.sh

3. Run the script:

./network_check.sh
